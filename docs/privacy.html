    <p>To provide our pollen forecast service, we may temporarily process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Location coordinates (when you grant permission) to fetch relevant pollen data</li>
        <li>Basic device information for compatibility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is processed temporarily and is not permanently stored on our servers.</p>

        secure.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
